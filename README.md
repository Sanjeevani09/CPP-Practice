# CPP Practice
<h3>C++ Practice Repository</h3>
Welcome to my C++ Practice Repository, a collection of solved problems and competitive programming challenges from platforms like HackerRank, CodeChef, HackerEarth, and LeetCode. This repository is a personal log of my journey to master C++ and improve my problem-solving skills through real-world coding exercises.

**<h3>Contents</h3>**
Here, youâ€™ll find solutions to a wide range of topics, including:

- **Data Structures** (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
- **Algorithms** (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)
- **Mathematical Problems** (number theory, combinatorics, etc.)
- **Competitive Programming Challenges** (optimization, problem analysis, etc.)
Each solution is carefully written in C++ and includes detailed comments to explain the approach, logic, and potential optimizations.

**<h3>Purpose</h3>**
This repository is aimed at:

- **Tracking Progress**: Monitoring my growth as a C++ programmer.
- **Problem Solving**: Tackling a variety of coding challenges to improve algorithmic thinking.
- **Sharing Knowledge**: Providing reference codes that others can learn from or use as inspiration for their solutions.
- **Open for Contribution**s: I welcome suggestions, improvements, or discussions around different problem approaches.

**<h4>How to Use</h4>**
- Explore the repository by topic or difficulty.
- Clone the repo and run the solutions on your local machine for deeper understanding.
- Feel free to raise an issue or suggest improvements!
